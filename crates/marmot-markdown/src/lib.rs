//! `marmot-markdown` — a hand-written, near-zero-dependency CommonMark parser
//! that emits an abstract syntax tree.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! 1. **Simplicity.** Straight-line parsing, no clever abstractions, no
//!    speculative generality.
//! 2. **Near-zero dependencies.** The only library dependency is `serde`
//!    for AST (de)serialization.
//! 3. **First-class nostr.** Two extra inline node types —
//!    [`Inline::NostrMention`] for bare `@npub1…` handles, and
//!    [`Inline::NostrUri`] for explicit `nostr:<hrp>1…` references —
//!    parsed inline alongside links and emphasis.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Two passes that are never fused:
//!
//! - **Pass 1 — block structure** ([`block`]): walks the input line by
//!   line, maintaining a stack of open containers (blockquote, list,
//!   list item) and at most one open leaf (paragraph, code, math, or
//!   table). Link-reference definitions are harvested at paragraph
//!   close.
//! - **Pass 2 — inline tokenization** ([`inline`]): walks the block tree
//!   and replaces each leaf's raw text with a `Vec<Inline>`. Emphasis,
//!   strikethrough, and links go through the spec's delimiter-stack +
//!   `process_emphasis` algorithm.
//!
//! ## HTML is not parsed
//!
//! Unlike CommonMark proper, this parser **does not** recognize HTML
//! blocks or raw HTML inlines. Tag-like sequences (`<div>`, `<!-- ... -->`,
//! etc.) are passed through as literal text and HTML-escaped at render
//! time. Only autolinks — `<scheme:body>` and `<email@host>` — get
//! structured treatment.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! use marmot_markdown::{Block, Inline, parse};
//!
//! let doc = parse("# Hi *there*");
//! assert!(matches!(
//!     doc.blocks.as_slice(),
//!     [Block::Heading { level: 1, .. }]
//! ));
//! ```
//!
//! All AST types implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` unconditionally.

/// Parse a CommonMark document (with this crate's nostr and GFM extensions)
/// into a [`Document`].
///
/// Recognized extensions on top of CommonMark 0.31:
///
/// - GFM tables (`| h | k |\n| - | - |\n| 1 | 2 |`).
/// - GFM strikethrough (`~~foo~~`).
/// - GFM task-list items (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`).
/// - Bare URLs (GFM-style extended autolinks) for the schemes `http://`,
///   `https://`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, `darkmatter://`, `whitenoise://`, and
///   `whitenoise-staging://`. Recognized at word boundaries; trailing
///   punctuation (`.,;:!?*_~` and unbalanced `)`) is excluded from the
///   matched URL. Opaque app-scheme forms like `darkmatter:foo` and
///   `whitenoise:foo` (no `//`) stay literal.
/// - Math: inline `$…$` and block `$$ … $$` (content is opaque — recognized
///   but never parsed as LaTeX).
/// - Nostr bare mentions (`@npub1…`) and URIs (`nostr:<hrp>1…`) for the
///   whitelisted HRPs `npub`, `note`, `nevent`, `nprofile`, `naddr`,
///   `nrelay`. `nsec` is deliberately rejected — we never render private
///   keys as ergonomic anchors. Bare `nostr:` URIs whose body isn't valid
///   bech32 stay as literal text (they are *not* downgraded to a generic
///   bare-URL autolink).
///
/// Bech32 strings are validated for *shape* only (no checksum).
