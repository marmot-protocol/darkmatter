//! RAII cleanup for locally staged OpenMLS pending commits.
//!
//! Commit-producing send paths stage an OpenMLS pending commit before they
//! cross transport wrapping and storage boundaries. Until the engine creates a
//! `PendingStateRef`, callers have no handle they can later pass to
//! `publish_failed`. This guard closes that orphan window: if the future is
//! dropped or returns early after staging but before the pending lifecycle is
//! handed off, `Drop` clears the OpenMLS pending commit best-effort.
//!
//! Several send paths (invite, auto-commit, remove-members, upgrade,
//! group-data-update) also create a fork-recovery snapshot via
//! `ForkRecoveryManager::create_snapshot` in the same orphan window. The normal
//! failure path `do_publish_failed` releases that snapshot through
//! `forget_pending_commit_for_recovery -> release_group_snapshot`; the guard
//! mirrors that so an early return / cancellation does not leak the
//! `fork-{epoch}-{n}-{hash}` snapshot row. Callers arm the guard *before*
//! creating the snapshot and attach the snapshot name with
//! [`PendingCommitCleanupGuard::set_snapshot`] once `create_snapshot` succeeds,
//! so the create-snapshot-then-stage-commit window is fully covered.
